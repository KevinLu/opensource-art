            <h4 style="color:#777">Steps to Contribute</h4>
                <p style="color:#999">Hi friend, it's so great that you want to contribute! If you are familiar with Github and version control, or
                want to give it a try (and we will help you if you run into trouble!) follow
                the <a href="https://www.github.com/vsoch/opensource-art" target="_blank">instructions at the repository</a>. If not, please 
                read the list of requirements, and fill in the following form (<a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Mp0wJHAcdFhxIThX2" target="_blank">full page here</a>), and we will contact you to get your image file. Please read these requirements carefully, as
                missing one will delay adding your contribution to the gallery.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4 style="color:#777">Image Requirements</h4>
                <p style="color:#999">1. There is technically no limit to the size and resolution of your image, however images with the largest dimension size 1024 tend to come out better. If your image is so large that it goes over the time limit of our robot artists, then we will ask you for a smaller image to add to the gallery.</p>
                <p style="color:#999">2. All images must be jpg, with extension "jpg"</p>
                <p style="color:#999">3. Image file names must be all lowercase, with numbers and special characters `-` and `_` allowed</p>
                <hr>
                <p style="color:#999">We strongly recommend you contribute via the <a href="https://www.github.com/vsoch/opensource-art" target="_blank">automated</a>
                approach on Github (and learn about version control!) for a much faster addition. Otherwise, fill out the 
                <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/Mp0wJHAcdFhxIThX2" target="_blank">full page form here</a>, and thank you for your contribution!
