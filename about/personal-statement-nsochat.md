# Natacha Villamia Sochat

The conceptual nature of this proposal embodies how an open society benefits from all of its members participating in its well-being. ‘The whole can be greater than any one of its parts’, an old but true cliché. This is a core tenet of Open Source values. 

As a child of immigrants I am very aware of being UpRooted. As an adult, rather than viewing cultural uprooting as a loss, I see the world a fuller, richer condition in which the seemingly chaotic disruption of clashing cultures actually results in the creation of stronger hybrid roots. 

My paintings that symbolize connectedness, collaboration, and the strength of this process. These paintings and objects will not be a wall of exclusion. They will embody the spirit of an open source society.

As an artist and biologist I use trees as a metaphor for connectedness on the microscopic and macroscopic scale.
We are inviting the public to participate in an art process [via the web](https://vsoch.github.io/opensource-art/about/, as well as allowing me as an artist to express the strength of inclusiveness with painting. These paintings will represent how we are all connected, and the strength of a society that does not build walls, but rather facilitates growth by inclusion. My collaborator Vanessa Sochat is a software engineer that embodies open source values. She will be creating the site where the public may participate in this inclusive event.

I am using crocheting as a connector to the paintings because it involves the hand and my labor. The hand is the mind, and labor is a valuable social force that always needs to be valued.

In addition, the project uses Github as the medium in its process. GitHub as well as RedHat embody open source values.
The entire project is also [available online](https://vsoch.github.io/opensource-art/).
