# Project Statement

[Open Source Art](https://vsoch.github.io/opensource-art) is a collaboration between programmer and artist
that embodies Red Hat's Open Source values, including open exchange, serendipity, community participation, and transparency.


## What is Opensource Art?

Open source development is historically associated primarily with programming, and open sharing of code.
In stark contrast, art is traditionally practiced in a rather closed fashion - the individual or small group of artists
works behind the scenes, often in messy smocks covered in paint or clay, to only reveal a final, finished piece against
the stark white cleanliness of a gallery where it is to be displayed. 
The underlying process, although it may be mentioned in a small paragraph
next to the work or assumed, is mainly hidden as a trade secret or impressive and known skill that the artist does not make
directly observable. Open Source Art is a project that makes all steps of development collaborative, publicly seen,
and enduring. This reposity combines open source development with community artistic contributions to create the first automated, programatically and manually generated gallery. While the project itself is scoped to fit within the scope of an in-person show,
it promises to live on long after the actual show has ended through this digital gallery.

## Background

There is typically a strong distinction between things that are made by hand, and by machine. 
It's also more likely the case that you see artist work attributed to one or a few individuals - the paintings in your favorite
gallery are done by one individual, or it's perhaps a collaboration between a small group.

Bring in open source. Open source is a powerful framework with under which many eyes can make tiny contributions to develop highly
complex systems. In the context of programming, this means that a group of developers opens up their code base for contributions from
the community, and many eyes on the code squash the bugs. 

Under this same model, many small artistic contributions can create unexpected beauty.

### Community Participation

The base of the entire gallery, whether it be code that drives its generation or the human hand, starts with a human component. 
Any member of the community can contribute a texture, a graphic, or digital piece. The contribution is done interactively
in an online interface, or via a pull request for those that are familiar with using Github. The contribution, such as a texture
created by a community member, can be discussed and reviewed if necessary. After discussion, it is added to the library housed in the repository. All steps in this process from submission to review and acceptance are open, community driven, and transparent,
presenting a drastically different model of artistic curation, which is typically a closed off process.

### Serendipity

From the human component, we have a version controlled collection of community contributions. Each carries with it metadata about the artist and (if one exists) a title and description. Here is where the machine, and concepts from software engineering like version control, continuous integration, and machine learning come into play! We use these technologies to automate the process of generating new works from the existing. We bring in an element of fun and surprise by using machine learning to generate a new work from the contributions.
By way of continuous integration and reproducible linux containeres, each day, a set of textures (or derivations from them) are randomly chosen to produce and save a new work for the digital gallery.

### An Open Source Art Story

Over time, the gallery grows in size and complexity. We generate a new set of images with each contribution, and the development of the gallery
is only limited to the ability of the algorithms and programmer. Improvements to the gallery might include:

 - Mixing previous images into the generation of new, so that earlier pieces become part of the later ones. The earliest contributions start the development of a story, and community members can contribute new textures (or similar) at any frequency to continue developing the story. 

Art is created and hung on walls to visually enjoy. There is an expectation of meaning. What goes unnoticed is the beauty and complexity
that emerges from writing code. It is the ultimate quiet expression of an individual's soul, and approached with the same kind of intense
focus as the artist. And if they do a good job? Ironically you don't notice anything at all, but you appreciate the product of the labor.
Thus, this project is beautiful because it captures more than one kind of beauty. This is the ultimate combination of open source practices, fun, and community, and we hope that you enjoy the gallery and possibly contribute to it.
