# Vanessa "VanessaSaurus" Sochat

I am a Research Software Engineer for Stanford Research Computing, with expertise
in systems design, container technologies, and reproducible practices. 
Programming is my passion and obsession, and open source software development 
is the motivation of avocados and love that drive my tiny dinosaur soul. I 
seek out work that is fun, meaningful, and challenging, and hope to share
this excitement with the larger community.
