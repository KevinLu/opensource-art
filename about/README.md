# Open Source Art

This is a collaboration between [@nsoch](https://www.github.com/nsoch) and [@vsoch](https://www.github.com/vsoch),
a mother daughter team that decided to have some fun and bring together their divergent interests of fine art and
programming to create something with sum larger than its parts. This folder contains application
materials intended for submission to the [Red Hat Open Gallery Call for Proposals](http://vaeraleigh.org/exhibitions/2018/7/10/red-hat-open-gallery-call-for-proposals). The programming part happens on here to encourage open source contribution of
textures and other inputs, and then to produce resulting works, and then the human hand again comes into play to
turn these digital inspirations into the actual pieces intended for the physical gallery.

## Application Materials

The following application materials are included here:

 - [Project Statement](project-statement.md) a summary (less than one page) that describes how the work here relates to Red Hat's Open Source Values.
 - [Budget](budget.md) includes a cost of materials and labor.
 - [Resumes](resumes) are included for each of @vsoch and @nsoch. Note that @vsoch is not a traditional artist, and does not have a history of exhibitions
 - [Proposed Timeline](proposed-timeline.md) a brief statement about expected timing for the exhibition.
 - [Inventory and Work Samples](inventory-samples) a folder with a guide and referenced samples that accompany this application
